#COMP 20 Web Programming Messages Revisited

###Summary
The required html file has been correctly implemented, which follows:

* Use jQuery to load the JSON and list messages inside the "messages" div (without the "Loading...") 
* The behavior of the work is exactly the same as the example that uses XMLHttpRequest: https://github.com/tuftsdev/WebProgramming/blob/gh-pages/examples/ajax/messages.html
* No for or while loop is used
* No document.getElementById() is used

###Acknowledgement
I finished all the work with the help of StackOverflow and Ming's lecture notes.
