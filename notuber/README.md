#COMP 20 Web Programming Assignment 2

The Black Car Service

###Summary
The required JSON API, a third-party Javascript API (Google Maps), the HTML5 geolocation API and the XMLHttpRequest object to make requests and manage the response data have been correctly implemented, which follow:

* The HTML file must be named index.html in a folder named notuber in your private Git repository. You can write your JavaScript in the HTML file
* The JavaScript navigator.geolocation object is used to retrieve the geolocation information (latitude and longitude)
* The JavaScript XMLHttpRequest object is used to make requests (i.e., send your information) and manage the response data
* The locations of all passengers OR vehicles are displayed, with an info window for each of which
* All the files passed the validator

###Acknowledgement
I finished all the work by myself. But I used StackOverflow for help a lot.

###Hours spent
Approximately 7 hours.
