1. hat is this purpose of this Git repository? 

	This is for a collection of homework for Ming Chow's course of COMP20 Web Programming at Tufts.

2. What was your favorite lab or assignment and why?

	I really like the server side project because I got a chance to learn how node.js and server side work. I also learned by myself how to use the template engine EJS.

3. How much do you think you have grown from day 1 of this course to now?

	I think I've foster a self-starter mentality that helps me achieve as a better programmer. 

4. What was the most important thing that you learned in this course? Cite two examples as evidence.

	Self-learning skills:
	Ming does not always cover everything in class, if I want to learn more I should always take the initiative to learn it by myself.
	Collaboration:
	Working with people for the final project has taught me a lot about teamwork and communication.

5. Now that you have finished the course, what topic would you like to delve deeper into?

	I will be taking Security next semester so I hope I can learn about it.
